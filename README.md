# 2. Dog Breed Classification

## Objective:

    •  Given a set of different dog breed images, build an image classifier to determine the breed of a dog in the image.

## Context:

    • Image Classification problem, which is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in 
      Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications.
## Dataset:
